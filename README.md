# Large Scale Traffic Signal Control Using a Novel Multiagent Reinforcement Learning

This folder (CoDQL_exp1) provides the experimental code in the simplified TSC simulator.

This folder (CoDQL_exp2) provides the experimental code in the more realistic TSC simulator.

  ==This folder (CoDQL_exp2/large_grid_larger) provides a realistic 7*7 traffic signal control simulator based on SUMO.
  
  ==Please call `build_file.py` under `[environment_dir]/data/` to generate SUMO network files
  ## Requirements
  * [SUMO](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Installing)
